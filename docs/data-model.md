# DA Services data model

Design baseline for every doctype the `da_services` Frappe app will own. Agree this
before building feature doctypes so each one is created once against a reviewed schema.

Status: **draft for team review** (Pushkar: field services; Yash: registry boundary;
Shikha: field names and vocabularies). Open questions are collected at the end.

Sources: FSD D3 (section 5 data model, 3.x functional requirements, Part 2 sections,
Appendix A), Part 1 HLD (sections 5, 7, 9, 10.3), DA Services Part 2 brief (sections
8–25), DA Registry field list (Shikha), staging portal, and what is already built
(`DA RBAC Assignment`, `DA Audit Event`).

---

> **Revision 6 Oct 2026.** Field names and enums were checked against the UI prototype source
> (`DA-registry-frontend`, see `docs/api-da-screens.md`). Additions from that pass are marked
> *(UI)*. Phase 1 freeze for the DA dashboard, farmers and visits screens: inventory rows
> 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16 (nine doctype groups).

## 1. Principles

1. **One authoritative owner per fact** (HLD 2.2). DA identity and posting live in the
   DA Registry (OpenG2P Gen 2); farmer master in the Farmer Registry; grievance cases in
   the Grievance Service; survey submissions in ODK Central. DA Services stores
   references, read-only projections where a page needs them, and its own operational
   records. It never becomes a second master and never edits another system's data
   directly.
2. **Operational facts are ours.** Visits, tasks, sync queue, leave, lifecycle
   decisions, KPIs, reviews, training, incentives, feedback issues, notifications,
   broadcasts: created and owned here.
3. **Every mutation is auditable and idempotent** (HLD 8.1, 10.3). Device-originated
   records carry a client operation id; outbound integrations carry a request reference;
   security-relevant actions write `DA Audit Event`.
4. **Status vocabularies come from the FSD/HLD**, not invented per screen (Appendix A of
   the HLD for sync states; FSD section 4 for workflow states).
5. **Physical work and synchronisation are separate state dimensions** (HLD 9.4): a
   visit's `physical_status` never changes because a sync failed.

## 2. Conventions

| Topic | Convention |
|---|---|
| Doctype names | Prefix `DA ` (e.g. `DA Visit`) so names cannot collide with other OAN apps on a shared bench |
| Naming series | `format:DA-<3-letter code>-{YYYY}-{#######}` for operational records; natural keys for lookups |
| External references | Plain `Data` fields, indexed: `da_id`, `farmer_id`, `external_case_id`, `submission_id`. Masters are external, so no `Link` |
| Users | `Link` to `User`; the DA user ↔ DA-ID binding comes from `DA RBAC Assignment` |
| Administrative codes | `region`, `zone`, `woreda`, `kebele` as codes (`Data`) today; `Link` to `DA Administrative Area` once the master is synced (migration path noted) |
| Device fields | `client_op_id` (unique per device operation, idempotency), `device_id`, `captured_at`, `sync_state` using the HLD 9.1 vocabulary |
| Timestamps | Frappe `creation`/`modified` plus domain times (`scheduled_at`, `completed_at`, `applied_at`) where they differ (HLD 10.3 "captured, submitted, processed, applied") |
| Attachments | Child table with `file` (Link File), `kind`, `content_hash`, `captured_at`; dedupe by hash (HLD 9.2) |
| Soft history | Nothing user-facing is hard-deleted: revoke, end, cancel, supersede. Registry-mirrored fields are read-only |
| Localisation | Labels in English and Amharic where shown to farmers/DAs: `*_en`, `*_am` on lookup and content doctypes |
| Permissions | DocPerms per role + `permission_query_conditions`/`has_permission` hooks for scope (pattern already in `permissions.py`). Every new doctype registers both before exposure |
| Audit | `track_changes: 1` on operational doctypes; `DA Audit Event` for denials, approvals, assignments, lifecycle decisions, integration outcomes |

---

## 4. Reference and registry bridge

### 4.1 DA Administrative Area (read-only lookup)

Tree of Region → Zone → Woreda → Kebele, refreshed from the master source. Never edited
in Desk. Source system is an open question (Catalog API, OpenG2P, or the seed the
Grievance app uses).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | Data, unique | e.g. `ET04`, `ET04-Z01`, `ET04-W01`, `ET04-W01-K03`; also the `name` |
| `level` | Select: Region / Zone / Woreda / Kebele | |
| `parent_area` | Link DA Administrative Area | `is_group` tree with `lft`/`rgt` for subtree queries |
| `name_en`, `name_am` | Data | |
| `active` | Check | |
| `boundary_ref` | Data | GIS boundary id/version for geofence checks |
| `source`, `source_version`, `last_synced_at` | Data / Data / Datetime | provenance |

### 4.2 DA Reference Value (dropdowns)

One generic lookup instead of a doctype per list. Lists: visit type, visit purpose,
task type, issue category, issue severity, grievance category, leave type, education
level, specialisation, position, certificate type, incentive type, broadcast audience
type, salutation, marital status.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `list_type` | Select (the list names above) |
| `code` | Data; `name` = `{list_type}:{code}` |
| `label_en`, `label_am` | Data |
| `sort_order` | Int |
| `active` | Check |
| `meta` | JSON (e.g. SLA hours for a severity) |

### 4.3 DA Agent Reference (registry projection)

A **read-only cache** of the slice of the DA record our pages show (dashboard header,
Supervisor lists, scope checks). The registry remains the master; rows here are written
only by the registry sync or by the lookup client, never by users. Exists because
Supervisor lists over 50–100 DAs and search over tens of thousands cannot call the
registry per row (NFR: search p95 ≤ 2 s). Requires decision B1 (integration path).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `da_id` | Data, unique (`name`) | |
| `full_name`, `salutation`, `father_name`, `grandfather_name` | Data | naming per Shikha's list; UI shows first/last — open question |
| `gender`, `marital_status` | Select | |
| `birth_month_ec`, `birth_year_ec` | Int | Ethiopian calendar, per field list |
| `phone`, `telegram`, `alternate_phone`, `email` | Data | |
| `education_level`, `specialisation`, `position` | Data (codes) | |
| `region`, `zone`, `woreda`, `kebele` | Data (codes) | assigned posting |
| `active_status` | Select: Active / On-leave / Separated | FSD 3.2.1 col 5 |
| `approval_status` | Select: Draft / Awaiting review / Changes requested / Approved / Published | |
| `fayda_status` | Select: Verified / Pending / Mismatch | |
| `joined_on` | Date | years of service |
| `farmer_count` | Int | *(UI)* My Teams, Assignments tiles; from Farmer Registry link count or registry |
| `supervisor_name`, `supervisor_title`, `supervisor_phone`, `supervisor_email` | Data | *(UI)* My Teams card; the Woreda supervisor of record |
| `source` | Select: Bulk import / MoA sync | *(UI)* registry provenance |
| `moa_publication` | Select: Published / Pending / Failed / Not sent | *(UI)* registry publication state, read-only |
| `photo_url` | Data | |
| `registry_version` | Data | optimistic concurrency when pushing outcomes |
| `last_synced_at`, `stale` | Datetime, Check | `stale` when older than policy |

Permissions: read for Supervisor (scoped by Woreda), Executive (Region), Admin; no
create/write for anyone (sync writes with `ignore_permissions`).

The `DAReference` dataclass in `integrations/da_registry/schemas.py` must grow the same
way: `phone`, `specialisation`, `joined_on`, `farmer_count`, `supervisor` *(UI)*.

### 4.4 DA Profile Change Request

DA self-service edits (contact, demographics, household, qualifications) that need Woreda
approval before they reach the registry (FSD 3.7).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `da_id`, `requested_by` (User) | Data / Link | |
| `section` | Select: Demographics / Contact / Household / Qualifications | self-service hub rows |
| `changes` | JSON | `{field: {from, to}}` |
| `attachments` | Table DA Attachment Row | evidence (certificate scans) |
| `status` | Select: Pending / Approved / Rejected / Changes requested / Applied | `Applied` = pushed to registry |
| `approver`, `decided_at`, `decision_note` | Link / Datetime / Small Text | |
| `registry_sync` | Link DA Integration Event | push result |
| `client_op_id`, `sync_state` | Data / Select | mobile origin |

---

### 4.5 DA Farmer Change Request *(UI)*

Farmer profile → "Request update". The Farmer Registry record is read-only here; the DA
requests a correction with evidence and the Registry team decides.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `farmer_id` | Data, indexed | |
| `requested_by_da_id`, `requested_by_user` | Data / Link | attribution shown in the modal |
| `field` | Select: phone / email / kebele / woreda / primary_crop | the editable subset |
| `current_value`, `new_value` | Data | |
| `reason` | Small Text | |
| `attachments` | Table | supporting documents |
| `state` | Select: Submitted / Accepted / Rejected / Applied | Registry decision |
| `external_ref`, `decided_at`, `decision_note` | Data / Datetime / Small Text | |
| `client_op_id`, `sync_state` | | |

---

## 5. Field services (DA role)

### 5.1 DA Farmer Link

The DA ↔ farmer relationship (FSD 3.5 agent–farmer association). Farmer master stays in
the Farmer Registry.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `da_id` | Data, indexed | |
| `farmer_id` | Data, indexed | Farmer Registry id |
| `kebele` | Data | |
| `mode` | Select: Automatic / Manual | FSD 3.5 |
| `relationship_state` | Select: Active / Ended / Pending sync | |
| `linked_at`, `ended_at` | Datetime | |
| `set_by` | Link User | Supervisor for manual |
| `end_reason` | Small Text | |
| `client_op_id`, `sync_state` | | |

Unique: (`da_id`, `farmer_id`) where `relationship_state = Active`.

### 5.2 DA Farmer Reference (projection)

Read-only cache of what the My Farmers list and offline visit need: `farmer_id`
(name), `full_name`, `phone`, `email` *(UI)*, `avatar_url` *(UI)*, `kebele`, `woreda`,
`region` *(UI)*, `household_size`, `plots_count`, `area_ha`, `primary_crop`, `fayda_state`,
`status_reason` *(UI, hover text for Pending / Flagged)*, `registered_on`,
`registry_version`, `last_synced_at`, plus two fields maintained by us: `visits_count` and
`last_visit_at` *(UI, updated on visit submit)* and `flags` (JSON, e.g. `voucher_redeemed_season`)
*(UI)*. UI status vocabulary: `Verified | Pending | Flagged` on rows, `Enrolling | Inactive`
also in filters; the projection stores the Farmer Registry's own state and the API maps it.
Written only by the Farmer Registry adapter. Pending-action chips (Crop survey due,
Livestock due, Credit in review, Fayda check, No action due) are **derived** from
tasks/visits/ODK/credit status at read time, not stored (FSD 3.4).

| `advisory_qa` | Table DA Visit Advisory QA | *(UI)* `question`, `answer`; Advisory visits only, shown on the farmer's Advisory tab |
| `client_op_id`, `device_id`, `sync_state` | | |

UI status mapping *(UI)*: list `Planned | Confirmed | Completed | Missed` and planner
`scheduled | completed | overdue` are derived from `physical_status` + `scheduled_at` +
`farmer_confirmation`; they are not stored.

Performance counting (HLD 9.4): a visit counts only when `physical_status = Physical

## 6. Supervision and lifecycle (Part 2)

### 6.1 Approval workflow pattern

Used by Lifecycle Transition, Leave Request and Profile Change Request (and the
registry's onboarding, which lives in OpenG2P). Implemented as a native Frappe Workflow
per doctype so the engine, not app code, decides legal moves and who may take them.

```

Every transition record carries: `reason`, `effective_date`, `approver`, `decision`,
`decision_note`, `decided_at`, resulting status, and a `DA Audit Event`. Approval and
application are separate states; MoA/Registry publication has its own retry.

### 6.2 DA Lifecycle Transition

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `DA-LCT-{YYYY}-{#######}` | |
| `da_id` | Data, indexed | |
| `transition_type` | Select: Transfer / Promotion / Specialisation change / Leave / Retirement / Reactivation / Separation | FSD 10.1 |
| `from_status`, `to_status` | Select (Active / On-leave / Separated) | |
| `from_kebele`, `to_kebele`, `from_woreda`, `to_woreda` | Data | Transfer |
| `from_grade`, `to_grade` | Data | Promotion |
| `specialisation` | Data | Specialisation change |
| `reason` | Small Text, required | |
| `effective_date` | Date, required | |
| `initiated_by` | Link User | Supervisor, or DA for self-service items |

### 6.3 DA Leave Request and DA Leave Balance

**DA Leave Request**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `da_id` | Data | |
| `leave_type` | Select: Annual / Sick / Statutory / Unpaid / Other | FSD 10.2 + brief |
| `from_date`, `to_date`, `days` | Date / Date / Float | `days` computed, working days per policy |
| `reason` | Small Text | |

**DA Leave Balance** (unique `da_id` + `year` + `leave_type`)

`entitlement_days`, `accrued_days`, `used_days`, `carry_over_days`, `remaining_days`
(computed), `policy_ref`, `last_recalculated_at`. Entitlement, accrual and carry-over
follow ATI policy inside this app (FSD 10.2: no external HR system).

### 6.4 KPI, goals, reviews

**DA KPI Definition**: `code` (name), `title`, `description`, `metric`, `unit`,
`weight_pct`, `direction` (Higher is better / Lower is better), `active`,
`applies_to_roles`, `formula_ref`. Validation across active definitions: weights sum to
exactly 100 (FSD FR-09e; approved set 30/25/20/15/10). Includes Data Accuracy KPI.

**DA KPI Evaluation**: `da_id`, `period` (e.g. `2026-Q3`), `kpi` (Link), `value`,
`data_state` (OK / No-data / Low-sample / Stale), `sample_n`, `source` (Aggregation /
Manual / CSV), `computed_at`, `entered_by`, `level` (DA / Kebele / Woreda / Region),
`area_code`. No false zeros: `No-data` renders blank.

**DA Goal**: `title`, `description`, `owner` (User), `assignees` (Table: `da_id`),
`metric`, `target_value`, `unit`, `horizon`, `due_date`, `weight_pct`, `status`
(Draft / Active / Achieved / Missed / Cancelled), `progress_pct`, `preset` (Data).
Warning when a DA's goal weights exceed 100%.

**DA Performance Review**: `da_id`, `cycle` (Quarterly / Semi-annual / Annual / Ad hoc),
`period_from`, `period_to`, `reviewer`, `goals` (Table: goal, achieved), `summary`,
`quality_score`, `sla_compliance_pct`, `training_completion_pct`, `overall_score`,
`comments`, `status` (Draft / Submitted / Approved), `submitted_at`, `approved_at`.
History events (Coaching / Recognition) as `DA Review Event` child or separate small
doctype: `da_id`, `event_type`, `note`, `by`, `at`.

**DA KPI Record** *(UI, KPI entry form and bulk import)*: `period` (e.g. 2026-Q3), `da_id`,
`woreda`, `kebele`, `visits`, `farmer_cases`, `needs_identified`, `support_actions`,
`reviews`, `training_pct`, `quality_pct`, `notes`, `source` (Manual / Import), `entered_by`,
`import_batch`. Unique per `period` + `da_id`. **DA KPI Tier Settings** (single): the T1–T4
thresholds (`t1_quality`, `t1_visits`, `t1_training`, `t2_quality`, `t2_visits`,
`t2_training`, `t3_quality`, `t4_training`), editable by Admin only. Tier per DA per period
is computed, not stored, except as a snapshot on the evaluation.

### 6.5 Certificates, training, incentives, advisors

**DA Certificate**: `da_id`, `title`, `issuing_org`, `cert_type` (Academic degree /
Professional certification / Training completion / Licence / Other), `issue_date`,
`expiry_date`, `reference_id`, `file` (Attach, PDF/JPG/PNG ≤ 5 MB), `notes`, `source`
(Upload / Agrilearn), `verification_status` (Pending verification / Verified /
Agrilearn-auto / Rejected), `verified_by`, `verified_at`. Counts toward qualification
tier only when Verified or Agrilearn-auto (FSD FR-07b).

**DA Training Record**: `da_id`, `training_id`, `training_name`, `provider`, `source`
(Agrilearn / External), `completion_status`, `completion_date`, `certificate` (Link),
`expiry_date`, `verification_status`, `last_synced_at`.

**DA Incentive Eligibility**: `da_id`, `incentive_type`, `period`, `eligibility_status`
(Eligible / Not eligible / Under review), `calculated_value`, `eligibility_reason`,
`source`, `reviewed_by`, `approved_by`, `status` (Draft / Reviewed / Approved / Paid
externally). No payment processing here.

**DA Dependent** *(UI, profile)*: `da_id`, `full_name`, `relationship` (Spouse / Son /
Daughter / Parent / Sibling / Other), `date_of_birth`, `approval_state` (Pending approval /
Verified / Rejected), `approved_by`, `approved_at`. Follows the approval workflow pattern
(6.1); the Supervisor queue shows it under kind "Profile change".

**DA Advisor**: `advisor_id` (name), `full_name`, `expertise_area`, `moa_unit`,
`region`, `woreda`, `phone`, `email`, `status` (Active / On-leave / Inactive). Reference
directory only; create/edit/delete for Admin and Supervisor.

## 7. Communication and surveys

**DA Knowledge Article**: `title_en/_am`, `summary_en/_am` *(UI)*, `body_en/_am`,
`snippet_en/_am` *(UI, SMS-ready, ≤ 160 chars)*, `category` (Crop production / Livestock /
Soil & water / Pest & disease / Markets & credit / Advisory) *(UI)*, `language_codes`,
`version`, `status` (Draft / Published / Archived), `published_at`, `author`, `sends`
(Int, maintained from dispatches) *(UI)*. **DA Knowledge Video** *(UI)*: `title`,
`category`, `summary`, `url`, `image`, `image_credit`.
**DA Knowledge Dispatch**: `article`, `sent_by`, `da_id`, `recipients` (JSON farmer ids
or segment), `channel` (SMS / Telegram), `sent_at`, `delivery_status`, `provider_ref`.

**DA Alert Signal**: `signal_type` (Knowledge / Emergency / Weather / Informational /
Grievance) *(UI)*, `severity` (Info / Warning / Critical) *(UI)*, `source`, `title`,
`detail`, `payload` (JSON), `received_at`, `status` (New / Dismissed / Dispatched),
`broadcast` (Link).

**DA Broadcast Message**: `signal` (Link), `body_en`, `body_am`, `sms_preview`,
`channels` (Table: channel SMS / Telegram), `audience_type` (DAs in Woreda / My linked
farmers / Farmers in Kebele / Farmer segment / Cooperative) *(UI)*,
`audience_filter` (JSON), `audience_snapshot_count`, `dispatched_by`, `dispatched_at`,
`delivery_status`, `receipts` (Table: channel, recipients, delivered, failed,
provider_ref, at), `evidence` (Table attachments) *(UI)*. A Development Agent may dispatch
only to *My linked farmers* or own Kebele, and only an article's approved snippet; free-text
broadcasts stay with Communications Officer / Admin *(UI finding)*.

**D28 survey** (FSD 3.9): `DA Survey Template` (`version`, `status`, `languages`,
`consent_required`, `approved_by`), `DA Survey Parameter` (child: `order`, `prompt_en/_am`,
`response_type` Consent / Auto-filled / Lookup / Rating 1–5 / Single choice /
Multi-select / Long text (UI codes `consent | auto | lookup | rating | single | multi | text`),
`required`, `options`, `helper`, `skip_condition` (`{parameter_id, equals}`), `prefill_source`
(Farmer Registry / DA assignment)),
`DA Survey Deployment` (`template`, `version`, `agents`/`kebeles`, `window_from/to`,
`status`), `DA Survey Response` (`deployment`, `collector_da_id`, `farmer_id`,
`consent`, `answers` JSON, `captured_at`, `sync_state`, `duplicate_guard_key` unique =
deployment + farmer). Editing an active template creates a new version.

## 8. System

### 8.1 DA Integration Event

One row per outbound command or inbound event to/from an external system.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `integration` | Select: Registry / MoA / Farmer Registry / Grievance / ODK / SMS / Telegram / Agrilearn / Master data | |
| `direction` | Select: Outbound / Inbound | |
| `entity_type`, `entity_name` | Data | our record |
| `operation` | Data | e.g. `push_lifecycle_outcome` |
| `request_ref` | Data, unique per integration | idempotency key |
| `payload_hash`, `payload_ref` | Data | payload stored in File when large |
| `status` | Select: Pending / Processing / Success / Failed / Retry / Dead letter / Divergent | HLD 6.1, brief 25 |
| `attempts`, `next_retry_at` | Int / Datetime | |
| `response_ref`, `external_reference` | Data | receipt |
| `error_message` | Small Text | |
| `correlation_id` | Data | |
| `scheduled_at`, `processed_at` | Datetime | |

Processed by Frappe background jobs with retry policy and dead-letter after N attempts;
Admin sees failures in a queue (Appendix A: sync failure → Administrator, portal).

**Reconciliation with PR #6 (DA-178, grievance adapter, in review).** That PR proposes a first
`DA Integration Event` with a grievance-only subset: `event_type` (Grievance Submit / Action /
Note / Reassign), `payload`, `reference_id`, `external_reference`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`,
`next_retry_at`, `completed_at`, `last_error`, statuses Pending / Processing / Completed /
Failed. This section is the **target** schema because the same queue must carry Farmer
Registry, ODK, Credit and messaging calls and needs an idempotency key. Mapping and the
additions requested on PR #6:

| PR #6 (v1) | Target (§8.1) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `event_type` (Select, grievance values) | `integration` (Select) + `operation` (Data) | `event_type` can stay as a free-text alias of `operation` |
| `reference_id` (free text) | `request_ref` (unique per integration) | carry `client_op_id` from the device; return the existing row on replay |
| `external_reference` | `external_reference` | same |
| `payload` (JSON) | `payload_hash` + `payload_ref` (File when large) | keep inline JSON for small payloads |
| `attempts`, `max_attempts`, `next_retry_at` | `attempts`, `next_retry_at` | `max_attempts` becomes a per-integration setting |
| `completed_at`, `last_error` | `processed_at`, `error_message` | rename |
| – | `direction`, `entity_type`, `entity_name`, `correlation_id`, `scheduled_at`, `response_ref` | add |
| Pending / Processing / Completed / Failed | Pending / Processing / Success / Failed / Retry / Dead letter / Divergent | Completed → Success; retryable failure → Retry; exhausted → Dead letter |

Until PR #6 adopts this, new integrations must not build on the v1 shape.

### 8.2 DA RBAC Assignment, DA Audit Event

## 12. Open questions

1. **Registry integration path (B1)**: OpenG2P Gen 2 directly or Part 1 service APIs? Decides how `DA Agent Reference` is refreshed (events vs polling) and where lifecycle outcomes are pushed.
2. **Is a local registry projection acceptable?** HLD allows projections; confirm with Yash the refresh policy and that it is never edited locally.
3. **DA naming and birth date**: Shikha's list has Name / Father / Grandfather and Month-Year of birth (EC); the UI shows First / Last and a full Gregorian date. Which does the registry store, and what do we mirror?
4. **Zone**: mandatory level or optional? Master source for Region/Zone/Woreda/Kebele codes and GIS boundaries?
5. **Approval status vocabulary**: FSD lists Draft / Awaiting review / Approved / Published; the workflow also needs Rejected and Changes requested. Confirm the registry's enum.
6. **Supervisors per Woreda** and whether any Supervisor may approve or a primary approver exists; Transfer needs both Woredas.
7. **Tasks**: confirm the task types and the rules that generate them (survey due cadence, report deadlines).
8. **Farmer Registry contract**: fields DAs may edit (non-identity), versioning for conflict checks, enrolment + OTP flow.
9. **Grievance Service**: status mapping and whether updates arrive by webhook or polling.
10. **ODK**: form ids/versions, context fields, Central status interface, duplicate keys.
11. **Leave policy**: entitlements, accrual, carry-over per leave type (ATI policy).
12. **KPI set**: the approved five KPIs behind 30/25/20/15/10 and the Data Accuracy KPI formula inputs.
13. **Attachments**: storage (Frappe private files vs object storage), retention and anonymisation rules for photos/GPS (ATI/MoA policy).
14. **Route prefix**: `/api/v1/da-services/` agreed with Pushkar; API doc to follow this model.
15. **Priority list source** *(UI)*: which system raises "Armyworm infestation" style alerts for the planner (Agrilearn, ODK survey result, plant-health signal, Supervisor flag)?
16. **Voucher flag** *(UI)*: "Input voucher redeemed this season" comes from which system?
17. **Credit service, Land Registry, payment gateway** *(UI)*: no contracts; accept and hold device captures, or hide the actions until contracts exist?
18. **Farmer visit confirmation** *(UI)*: entered by the DA, or from an inbound SMS reply (needs a webhook)?
19. **Weekly crop report** *(UI)*: the ODK crop survey or a separate DA report form?
20. **DA broadcast** *(UI)*: may a DA dispatch snippets to own linked farmers (prototype allows it; FSD gives broadcast to Communications Officer)?
21. **Who edits beneficiary segment rules and KPI tier thresholds** *(UI)*: prototype says Supervisor/Admin for segments, Admin for tiers.
22. **Supervisor-assigned visits** (`assigned_by`) *(UI)*: in scope for phase 1?
