"""Typed shapes exchanged with the DA Registry.

These are *our* projection of registry data, not the registry's contract. Whatever the
final API looks like (OpenG2P Gen 2 directly or the Part 1 FastAPI services, still to be
confirmed), mapper.py translates into these and the rest of the app never sees raw
payloads. Keep them minimal: DA Services holds references and read models, never a
second DA master (HLD 2.2).
