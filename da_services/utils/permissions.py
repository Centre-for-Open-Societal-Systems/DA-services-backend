"""Deny-by-default authorization (FSD 3.1.1, HLD 3 and 10.1).

A Frappe Role answers *what actions exist for you*. It never answers *which DAs you may
touch*. That is answered by the user's live DA RBAC Assignment rows: their Region, Zone
and Woreda scope and, for a Development Agent, the single DA-ID they are bound to. HLD 3
is explicit that "RBAC is necessary but not sufficient", so every service call passes
through here before it reads or writes anything.

UI visibility is not authorization. These checks run in the backend on every request,
and every denial is written to the audit log.
